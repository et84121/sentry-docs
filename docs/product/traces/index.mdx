<Note>
The Traces page is currently in beta. Beta features are still in progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

The [**Traces**](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/performance/traces/) page lets you search for individual spans that make up a trace, linked by a trace id. This gives you a connected view of your application from the frontend to the backend and/or between different applications and workflows. You can query and find particular distributed traces to help you debug problems or optimize hot paths in your application.

## How to Build a New Traces Query
The **Traces** page has a query builder for spans where you can create a new query by applying up to three search conditions. All your search conditions should be targeting spans. Each set of span conditions matches a span in a trace. By adding one set of span conditions, you can search all spans.

The following example shows you all traces where:
- A user with the email `foo@example.com` loaded a page on your frontend on a specific route

Note, that adding multiple span conditions will only return traces that contain ALL span conditions.

The following example lets you find a trace where:
- A user with the email `foo@example.com` loaded a page on your frontend on a specific route
- AND within that same trace, there was a slow database span

### Filter by Environment and Date Range

These common filters allow you to filter on your environments, as well as specify the date range you want to zoom in on.

Since traces are distributed in nature, there is no page-wide project filter, but you can filter on projects per set of span conditions by adding `project:your-project-here` in the search.

### Filter by Search Conditions

All events have built-in key fields or custom tags, this includes our span data. Use the search bar to enter these keys and assign them values. This will filter down your list of events. For a list of the built-in key fields, check out our [Searchable Properties for spans documentation](/product/sentry-basics/search/searchable-properties/spans).


## Interpreting Query Results

![Page displaying search conditions for a trace and results of that search.](./img/traces-results.png)

Each row in the results represents a trace. The first row of the table is auto-expanded to help you interpret the results while searching.

For each of the top-level trace rows in the table we display:

- A trace id, which links out to the trace in question in the more granular [Trace Details](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/trace-view/) view.
- The project that the traces are part of.
- A trace name, derived from either the root transaction, or the first transaction (if the trace doesn't have a consistent root transaction).
- The number of spans matching your search conditions for that trace. (This differs from the total number of spans inside that trace.)
- An approximate timeline of significant spans inside the trace (to help visually interpret span start and end times).
- A duration, which is calculated by looking at the beginning of the first span and the end of the last span in a trace.
- The relative time for when the trace happened, which also contains the exact time if you hover over it.
- A link to any issues associated with the trace.

Within each trace, we also return some of your matching spans to help you interpret your search conditions. In this span table within each trace we display:

- A span id, which links to the [Trace Details](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/trace-view/) page.
- A span description, which includes the project, as well as a `span.op` and `span.description` to help you identify the span.
- The span timeline, which you can use with the trace timeline above to get an idea of when and where in the trace the span happened.
- The span duration.
- The relative time of when the span happened.


## Syntax

The Traces Query Builder syntax is identical to [Sentry's Search syntax](/product/sentry-basics/search/). After you enter a key field from above or a custom tag, you can use any of the referenced syntax. For example, `count()` gives you the number of times an event occurs. This can be written in the following ways:

- Exact match (is equal to): `span.duration:99`
- Upper bounds (is less than or equal to): `span.duration:<99` or `span.duration:<=99`
- Lower bounds (is more than or equal to): `span.duration:>99` or `span.duration:>=99`
- Multiple bounds (is more and less than): `span.duration:>10 span.duration:<20`

You can use `OR` and `AND` search conditions between filters. However, `OR` cannot be used between aggregate and non-aggregate filters. For more details about these conditions, see [Using `OR` and `AND`](/product/sentry-basics/search/#using-or-and-and).

You can also search multiple values for the same key by putting the values in a list. For example, "x:[value1, value2]" will find the same results as "x:value1 `OR` x:value2". You can learn more by reading about [Multiple Values on the Same Key](/product/sentry-basics/search/#multiple-values-on-the-same-key).
