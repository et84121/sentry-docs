On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's Apple SDK, automatically reporting errors and exceptions in your application.

<Note>

If you don't already have an account and Sentry project established, head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

</Note>

<PlatformSection supported={["apple.visionos"]}>

<Alert level="info" title="Experimental Support">

The support for [visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/visionos/) is currently experimental.
Experimental support means it may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons

    'error-monitoring',

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application's runtime. These are platform-specific and allow Sentry to have a deep understanding of how your application works.

<PlatformSection notSupported={["apple.ios"]}>

We recommend installing the SDK with Swift Package Manager (SPM), but we also support alternate [installation methods](install/). To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project, open your App in Xcode and open **File > Add Packages**. Then add the SDK by entering the git repo url in the top right search field:

```
https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["apple.ios"]}>
We recommend installing the SDK through our installation wizard by running the following command inside your project directory:

```bash
brew install getsentry/tools/sentry-wizard && sentry-wizard -i ios
```

[Sentry Wizard](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard) will patch your project accordingly, though you can [set up manually](/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/manual-setup/) if you prefer. You only need to patch the project once. Then you can add the patched files to your version control system.

<Expandable title="The following tasks will be performed by the Sentry Wizard">

- install the Sentry SDK via Swift Package Manager or Cocoapods
- update your `AppDelegate` or SwiftUI App Initializer with the default Sentry configuration and an example error
- add a new `Upload Debug Symbols` phase to your `xcodebuild` build script
- create `.sentryclirc` with an auth token to upload debug symbols (this file is automatically added to `.gitignore`)
- when you're using Fastlane, it will add a Sentry lane for uploading debug symbols

</Expandable>

</PlatformSection>

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

Verify that your app is sending events to Sentry by adding the following snippet, which includes an intentional error. You should see the error reported in Sentry within a few minutes.

<Note>

To verify crashes, ensure you run your application without a debugger attached. Otherwise, the SDK will not capture the crash.

</Note>

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

do {
    try aMethodThatMightFail()
} catch {
    SentrySDK.capture(error: error)
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

NSError *error = nil;
[self aMethodThatMightFail:&error]

if (error) {
    [SentrySDK captureError:error];
}
```
