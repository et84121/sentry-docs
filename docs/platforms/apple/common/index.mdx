On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's SDK.

Don't already have an account and Sentry project established? Head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application's runtime.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Configure

<PlatformContent
  includePath="configure-early-in-app-lifecycle"
  notSupported={["apple.ios"]}
/>

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

Verify that your app is sending events to Sentry by adding the following snippet, which includes an intentional error. You should see the error reported in Sentry within a few minutes.

<Note>

To verify crashes, ensure you run your application without a debugger attached. Otherwise, the SDK will not capture the crash.

</Note>

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

do {
    try aMethodThatMightFail()
} catch {
    SentrySDK.capture(error: error)
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

@import Sentry;

NSError *error = nil;
[self aMethodThatMightFail:&error]

if (error) {
    [SentrySDK captureError:error];
}
```
